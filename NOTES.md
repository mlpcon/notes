# Decisions made
- /mlp/ con 2023 will be held June 30-July 2, 2023
- there will be vendors this year
- the web site needs to be updated for 2023
- will try to schedule events so that overtly non-FiM stuff (EQG, G5) gets put into the secondary CyTube and not the primary one
- there will be breaks between events (at least 15 minutes)
- pon3.stream will be available to stream NSFW content
- we will be streaming on CyTube
- Spec is banned from hosting panels/events (carryover from last year, will stand unless there are objections)
- The anons who ran the Minecraft server in previous years have announced they won't be doing it again this year due to lack of interest (if someone else wants to host, pls speak up)
