Just a few days until /mlp/ con!
If CyTube is still broken and we can't stream YouTube videos, uhhhh unless someone has another suggestion, we may have to do HAHcon rules: Publish a schedule with separate YouTube video/livestream links and have everyone independently go there when it's time.
Really not ideal, any other suggestions?

Reminder the con dates are THIS FRIDAY - SUNDAY
SCHEDULE: https://mlpcon.online/schedule.html

>How do I participate?
Hopefully we'll be meeting up on CyTube and posting in the thread during the con.
Panels may ask for audience participation and questions in thread or in CyTube chat (or worst case in YT chat).
