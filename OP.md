OK, well, we have a total of......5 panel apps submitted.
Less than 7 weeks until con weekend.
Maybe we only need a day this year lol

- Discuss ideas about events/panels you'd like to host
- Take the initiative and reach out to people who would make for a good interview, guests from the show or others in the fandom that aren't from the board (don't lie to them and don't pull a Spec; if you are uncomfortable actually performing the interview, we can get someone to help with that)

- Host a panel or event or record a special video to be premiered during the con
- Create short funny videos that could be shown during downtime (along with selections queued up by other congoers)
